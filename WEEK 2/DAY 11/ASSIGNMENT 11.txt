1.How to add or remove classes in javascript?
Add a class name to the div element with id="myDIV" (in this example we use a button to add the class).
Example
<button onclick="myFunction()">Try it</button>
<div id="myDIV">
  This is a DIV element.
</div>

Remove Class
we will use a button to remove the "mystyle" class from the <div> element with id="myDIV":
Example
<button onclick="myFunction()">Try it</button>
<div id="myDIV" class="mystyle">
  This is a DIV element.
</div>


2.what is cdn and why it is used?

A CDN is a network of servers that distributes content from an “origin” server throughout the world
 by caching content close to where each end user is accessing the internet via a web-enabled device. 
The content they request is first stored on the origin server and is then replicated and stored elsewhere as needed.

3.What is Minification
Minification is the process of minimizing code and markup in your web pages and script files. 
It’s one of the main methods used to reduce load times and bandwidth usage on websites. 
Minification dramatically improves site speed and accessibility, directly translating into a better user experience. 
It’s also beneficial to users accessing your website through a limited data plan and who would like to save on their bandwidth usage while surfing the web.
