1. What is JSON?

JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation

JSON is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data

JSON is often used when data is sent from a server to a web page

JSON is "self-describing" and easy to understand


2. Study the data that returned by the below url:

JSON.stringify()
A common use of JSON is to exchange data to/from a web server.
When sending data to a web server, the data has to be a string.
Convert a JavaScript object into a string with JSON.stringify().

<p id="demo"></p>
<script>
const obj = {name: "John", age: 30, city: "New York"};
const myJSON = JSON.stringify(obj);
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = myJSON;
</script>




JSON.parse()
When receiving data from a web server, the data is always a string.
Parse the data with JSON.parse(), and the data becomes a JavaScript object.


<p id="demo"></p>
<script>
const txt = '{"name":"John", "age":30, "city":"New York"}'
const obj = JSON.parse(txt);
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = obj.name + ", " + obj.age;
</script>
