1. Find the answers for the following questions: 
	a. What is the eval() method?
The eval() method evaluates or executes an argument.

If the argument is an expression, eval() evaluates the expression. If the argument is one or more JavaScript statements, eval() executes the statements.


	b. What is the purpose of  prev() and next()  methods in jQuery?  

    The prev() method returns the previous sibling element of the selected element.sibling elements are elements that share the same parent.

    next() method allows us to search through the immediately following sibling of these elements in the DOM tree and construct a new jQuery object from the matching elements. The method optionally accepts a selector expression of the same type that we can pass to the $() function.

$(table tr).slice(1).remove();

$("#id_of_table").find("tr:gt(0)").remove();


d. How to perform animation based on the width? prepare an example? 

    The animate() method performs a custom animation of a set of CSS properties.

This method changes an element from one state to another with CSS styles. The CSS property value is changed gradually, to create an animated effect.

Only numeric values can be animated (like "margin:30px"). String values cannot be animated (like "background-color:red"), except for the strings "show", "hide" and "toggle". These values allow hiding and showing the animated element.

Tip: Use "+=" or "-=" for relative animations.

Syntax
(selector).animate({styles},speed,easing,callback)
