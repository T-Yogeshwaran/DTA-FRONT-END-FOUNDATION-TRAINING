1.    What is map() method in Array?   How to use map() method?

2.   Find the details about following methods of Array:
					find(),  findIndex(),  filter()



Use case 1 : Find :
Use array ‘find’ method to traverse through the array to get a result of single entity when the condition matches for very first time else returns ‘undefined’.
Loop executes only till the first match. CallbackFn is run even for indexes with unassigned values.


Use case 2 : Filter :
Use array ‘filter’ method to traverse through the array to get results of all entities for which the condition matches else returns empty array ’[]’.
Loop executes for all the entities. CallbackFn doesn’t run for indexes with unassigned values.


Use case 3: FindIndex :
Use array ‘findIndex’ method to traverse through the array to get an integer result of ‘index number’ when the condition matches for any entity for first time else returns ‘-1’.
Loop executes only till the first match. CallbackFn is run even for indexes with unassigned values.
