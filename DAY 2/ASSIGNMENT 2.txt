2.What is querystring?

A query string is the portion of a URL where data is passed to a 
web application and/or back-end database. 
The reason we need query strings is that the HTTP protocol is stateless by design. 
For a website to be anything more than a brochure, you need to maintain state (store data). 
There are a number of ways to do this: On most web servers, you can use something like session state server-side. 
On the client, you can store via cookies. Or in the URL, you can store data via a query string.
