2. What is the purpose of "alt" attribute of img tag? 
•	The alt attribute specifies an alternate text for an area, if the image cannot be displayed. 
•	The alt attribute provides alternative information for an image if a user for some reason cannot view it (because of slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader)

3. Why do we use tbody, thead, tfoot tags?

Tbody ->
•	The <tbody> tag is used to group the body content in an HTML table.
•	The <tbody> element is used in conjunction with the <thead> and <tfoot> elements to specify each part of a table (body, header, footer).
•	Browsers can use these elements to enable scrolling of the table body independently of the header and footer. Also, when printing a large table that spans multiple pages, these elements can enable the table header and footer to be printed at the top and bottom of each page.s
